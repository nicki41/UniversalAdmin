/**
 * Full live projection for {@code PlayerProfilePage} - built on demand by
 * {@link PlayerService#snapshot(UUID)}, never persisted (see
 * docs/user/modules/players.md for why: everything here either comes
 * straight from Bukkit at render time, or - for {@code totalPlaytime}/
 * {@code firstJoin}/{@code lastSeen} - is already tracked by Bukkit itself).
 * Every field below the identity/online fields is {@code null} (or {@link
 * #activeEffects()} empty) when it genuinely isn't available - offline
 * players have no live world/health/gamemode/ping/effects without NMS, which
 * this project doesn't use. IP address is deliberately not here at all; see
 * {@code GetPlayerIpAddressAction}.
