# Configuration

Two files, generated on first start:

- `plugins/UniversalAdmin/config.yml` - all settings
- `plugins/UniversalAdmin/lang/en_US.yml`, `plugins/UniversalAdmin/lang/de_DE.yml` - your own texts (see [Localization](#localization))
- `plugins/UniversalAdmin/punishment-templates.yml` - punishment templates (see [moderation.md](modules/moderation.md#punishment-templates))

Every value below is a registered, typed, validated setting (see
[docs/development/settings.md](../development/settings.md) for how that
works internally) - an invalid value never crashes the server, it logs a
warning and falls back to its default.

**Easiest way to change anything:** in-game via `/admin` → Settings, or
`/admin settings set <path> <value>` - see
[modules/settings.md](modules/settings.md). The shipped `config.yml` lists
every setting of every module with a comment; the module docs describe
their own settings in detail.

## `general`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `general.language` | locale code | `en_US` | Must look like `xx_XX`. Reloadable live. |

## `database`

| Key | Type | Default | Restart required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `database.type` | `sqlite` \| `mysql` | `sqlite` | yes |
| `database.file` | string | `data.db` | yes |
| `database.host` | string | `localhost` | yes |
| `database.port` | integer, 1-65535 | `3306` | yes |
| `database.database` | string | `universaladmin` | yes |
| `database.username` | string | `universaladmin` | yes |
| `database.password` | string | `""` | yes |
| `database.ssl` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `database.pool-size` | integer, 1-100 | `10` | yes |

`type: mysql` is also used for MariaDB - the bundled driver speaks
MariaDB's wire protocol, which MySQL servers accept too, so there's no
separate `mariadb` value. All database settings require a restart: a live
connection-pool swap mid-session is exactly the kind of "unsafe to change
live" setting `/admin reload` deliberately refuses to attempt (see
[Reload](#reload)).

See [Database](database.md) for SQLite vs. MySQL/MariaDB in more depth -
when to use which, setting up a MySQL user, what happens if the database
is unreachable at startup, and backups.

## `gui`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gui.page-size` | integer, multiple of 9, 9-54 | `45` | Reloadable live. |
| `gui.confirmations` | boolean | `true` | Ask before destructive GUI actions. Reloadable live. |
| `gui.status-line` | boolean | `true` | Show staff what they have switched on (vanish, staff mode, godmode, staff chat, nick, and switches of extensions) in the action bar, e.g. `Vanish · Godmode`, while something is on. Reloadable live. |

`gui.confirmations` applies to every confirmation dialog of every module.

## `audit`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Whether `AuditService` records events. Reloadable live. |
| `audit.retention-days` | integer | `0` | How many days of audit history to keep; `0` = unlimited (never deleted). Cleanup runs hourly via `AuditLogModule`, not on every tick - see [docs/user/audit-log.md](audit-log.md#retention). |

## `modules`

| Key | Type | Default | Restart required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `modules.players` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.moderation` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.reports` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.chat` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.nick` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.server` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.worlds` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.whitelist` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.performance` | boolean | `true` | yes |
| `modules.audit` | boolean | `true` | Controls the **Audit Log** module (its GUI/commands over `AuditService`) - not the same as `audit.enabled` above, which controls whether `AuditService` records anything at all. |
| `modules.settings` | boolean | `true` | yes |

Setting one to `false` means that module is never even registered with
`ModuleManager` - not disabled-after-the-fact, simply never brought up.
Requires a restart: modules are only registered once, at plugin startup.

## `commands`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `commands.shortcuts.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Top-level shortcuts such as `/kick` next to `/admin kick`. Restart required. |
| `commands.shortcuts.disabled` | list | `[]` | Shortcut labels to skip, e.g. `[ban, mute]`. Restart required. |

`/report` and `/staffchat` are always registered; `/universaladmin:<label>`
always works. See [commands.md](commands.md).

## `network`

Only for servers behind a Velocity or BungeeCord proxy that share one MySQL
database - the setup is in [network.md](network.md).

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `network.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Network mode. Needs `database.type: mysql`. Restart required. |
| `network.server-name` | string | `""` | This server's name exactly as the proxy knows it. Empty: asked from the proxy when the first player joins. Restart required. |
| `network.poll-interval` | duration | `1s` | How often messages from the other servers are fetched (250ms - 10s). Restart required. |
| `network.list-other-servers` | boolean | `true` | Also list servers without UniversalAdmin, as the proxy reports them. |

## Module sections

Each module keeps its settings in its own section - `players.*`,
`moderation.*`, `reports.*`, `chat.*`, `nick.*`, `server.*`, `whitelist.*`,
`performance.*` - documented in the module pages:
[players](modules/players.md#settings),
[moderation](modules/moderation.md#settings),
[staff tools](modules/staff-tools.md),
[reports](modules/reports.md#settings), [chat](modules/chat.md#settings),
[nick](modules/nick.md#settings),
[server](modules/server.md), [whitelist](modules/whitelist.md),
[performance](modules/performance.md#settings).

## `performance`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `performance.refresh-interval` | duration, 1s-10m | `5s` | How often the Performance module refreshes its TPS/MSPT/memory/world/entity snapshot. Restart required. |

Alert thresholds and entity-clear protection: see
[docs/user/modules/performance.md](modules/performance.md#settings).

Duration values accept a bare number of seconds, or a suffix: `30s`, `5m`,
`1h`, `2d`, `250ms`.

## `maintenance`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maintenance.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Initial maintenance state on a fresh install; afterwards `/admin maintenance on\|off` and its stored state win. |
| `maintenance.kick-message` | string (MiniMessage) | `<red>Server is currently under maintenance.` | Default message for players who cannot join. Reloadable live. |

## `update`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `update.check-for-updates` | boolean | `true` | Check GitHub for newer stable releases of UniversalAdmin and its extensions and tell staff and the console. `/admin update` works either way. |
| `update.check-interval` | duration, 1h-7d | `6h` | Restart required. |
| `update.auto-download` | boolean | `true` | Download a newer release into `plugins/update/` on its own - applied at the next restart. Only within the same major version; a new major version waits for `/admin update`. |

## `telemetry`

Anonymous usage statistics. The full payload, the opt-out, and everything that
is deliberately never collected are documented in
[docs/user/telemetry.md](telemetry.md) - that document is the complete list,
and nothing is collected that isn't in it.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `telemetry.enabled` | boolean | `true` | `false` means no request of any kind, no installation id, no timer. Re-read on **every** heartbeat, so `/admin reload` applies a change immediately - no restart needed. The endpoint itself is not configurable - see [telemetry.md](telemetry.md). |
| `telemetry.interval` | duration, 5m-24h | `30m` | Time between heartbeats; a random extra of up to half this value is added to each wait. The first heartbeat additionally waits ~5-7 minutes after startup. Restart required. |

## `web`

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Reserved for the future web app (see [docs/architecture/web-future.md](../architecture/web-future.md)). No web server exists yet - this flag currently does nothing. |

## Reload

```
/admin reload
```

Requires `universaladmin.reload` (default: op). Re-reads `config.yml`,
migrates it if its `config-version` is behind, and re-resolves every
setting:

- Settings that don't need a restart apply immediately.
- Settings that do (see the tables above) keep their previous value; the
  command reports which ones are "pending restart".
- A value that fails to parse or validate falls back to its default and is
  reported, same as at startup - reload never leaves the plugin in a
  broken state.

It also re-reads the language files in `lang/` and `punishment-templates.yml`.

This is **not** Bukkit's `/reload` - it never touches any other plugin or
the server's own state, only UniversalAdmin's own files.

## Config versioning

`config-version` at the top of the file is managed automatically - don't
edit it by hand. Upgrading UniversalAdmin never blindly overwrites your
existing `config.yml`; when the config's shape changes, a migration adjusts
your file in place. Version 2 (UniversalAdmin 1.0) moved module settings
under their module (`vanish.*` → `moderation.vanish.*`, `countdown.*` →
`server.countdown.*`, `gui.max-results` → `players.gui.max-results`, ...)
and added the `commands` section. Version 3 (UniversalAdmin 1.1) added the
`network` section and raised the staff-mode target range from 40 to 128
blocks if you still had the old default. See
[docs/development/settings.md](../development/settings.md#config-file-versioning).

## Localization

`lang/en_US.yml` is the default and the fallback for every other locale;
`lang/de_DE.yml` ships alongside it. `general.language` selects the active
one.

**Your files hold only your texts.** `plugins/UniversalAdmin/lang/<locale>.yml`
starts out with nothing but an explanation. To change a text, copy its key
from `lang/reference/<locale>.yml` - every built-in text, rewritten on every
start - into your file, keep the nesting, and `/admin reload`. Every text
you don't have comes from the plugin, so new and corrected texts arrive with
every update.

Up to 1.7.0 the whole built-in file was copied into `lang/` once and then
hid every later correction. 1.7.1 cleans such a copy once: texts that are
UniversalAdmin's own (of any version) are removed, the texts you changed
stay. The old file is kept as `lang/<locale>.yml.before-1.7.1`. See
[ADR 0026](../architecture/decisions/0026-language-files-hold-only-overrides.md).

**Fallback chain** for any single message key: your file for the active
locale → the built-in copy of that locale → your `en_US.yml` → the built-in
`en_US` → a visible `[missing: the.key]` marker (logged once).

**Adding a locale:** drop a new `lang/xx_XX.yml` file (anything you skip
falls back to `en_US`), set `general.language` to match, `/admin reload`.

A broken language file (YAML error) is skipped with an error in the
console - the plugin keeps running with the built-in texts.

**Placeholders and apostrophes:** `{0}`, `{1}`, ... are replaced by values.
In a text that has placeholders, write an apostrophe as `''` (two single
quotes). Values typed by players (reasons, report texts, chat) are always
shown as plain text and can never add colours or click events.

Message values may use [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)
markup (e.g. `<green>...</green>`) - see the shipped `lang/en_US.yml` for
examples. This does **not** apply to a future web client, which would
render the same underlying message key differently (plain text/HTML
instead of an Adventure `Component`) - see
[docs/architecture/web-future.md](../architecture/web-future.md).
