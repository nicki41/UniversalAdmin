# Testing

## Principle

Business logic (services, actions, non-trivial migrations) must be
testable without a running Paper server. That's the real test of whether
the layering from [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) was actually
followed - if a service can't be tested without Bukkit mocking, business
logic probably ended up somewhere that should have stayed frontend/adapter.

## Tools

- JUnit 5 (Jupiter) - test framework.
- Mockito - available (`testImplementation`), but not the first choice:
  see below.
- No Paper server mocking framework (MockBukkit or similar) set up
  currently. Becomes relevant once `GuiPage` implementations or Bukkit
  event listeners with meaningful logic of their own show up (see
  [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) Phase 1) - don't add it prematurely
  before then.

## Repositories: Fakes Instead of Mocks

A service depends on a `Repository` *interface* - that can be faked with a
simple in-memory implementation instead of mocking every method with
Mockito. A fake behaves like a real implementation (consistent state
across multiple calls), a mock only responds to what was explicitly
programmed - for repository tests, a fake is usually the test that
actually checks service behavior instead of just the call sequence.

Example:
[`PlayerServiceTest`](../../src/test/java/dev/universaladmin/modules/players/PlayerServiceTest.java)
- a `record` implementing `PlayerProfileRepository` against a
`ConcurrentHashMap`, directly in the test class.

Mockito is the right choice when a dependency needs to simulate *behavior*
a simple fake can't reasonably represent (e.g. a failure case hard to force
through real state).

## Migrations: a Real SQLite Database, No Mock

Test `Migration`/`MigrationRunner` against a real, temporary SQLite file
(`@TempDir` + `DataSourceFactory`), not against a mocked `Connection` - SQL
syntax errors only show up against a real database. Example:
[`MigrationRunnerTest`](../../src/test/java/dev/universaladmin/storage/MigrationRunnerTest.java).

**Important on Windows:** close the `DataSource` (HikariCP) created by
`DataSourceFactory.create(...)` at the end of the test
(`((AutoCloseable) dataSource).close()`), or JUnit's `@TempDir` can't
delete the file after the test because SQLite is still holding it open.

## Settings/Config: a Real `YamlConfiguration`, No Mock

Same as for migrations: test `YamlSettingsService` against a real
(in-memory) `org.bukkit.configuration.file.YamlConfiguration`
(`config.loadFromString("gui:\n  page-size: 27\n")`), not against a mocked
`FileConfiguration` - `YamlConfiguration` is a plain data-structure class
in `paper-api`, no server needed. For a reload between two values, an
`AtomicReference<YamlConfiguration>` read by the `Supplier<FileConfiguration>`
is enough. Example:
[`YamlSettingsServiceTest`](../../src/test/java/dev/universaladmin/settings/YamlSettingsServiceTest.java).

Test `YamlLocaleMessageService` the same way, against real `lang/*.yml`
files written into a `@TempDir`, not against a mocked message map - see
[`YamlLocaleMessageServiceTest`](../../src/test/java/dev/universaladmin/localization/YamlLocaleMessageServiceTest.java).
`SettingsService` itself (only for `general.language`) is fine to mock
here, because this test isn't checking the settings system, only the
locale fallback logic.

## What's Still Missing

- Tests for the eight module skeletons follow once they get real logic
  beyond `PlayersModule`/`PlayerService` (see
  [adding-module.md](adding-module.md)).
- Permission tests so far only at the validation level
  (`PermissionNodeTest`) - tests for actual authorization *decisions*
  follow with the first action that makes one.
- No integration test running `UniversalAdminPlugin#onEnable` end to end
  (would need a Paper test server) - deliberately deferred until there's a
  concrete need for it.
